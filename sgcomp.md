We organize competitions in prominent venues such as CEC, WCCI, and GECCO, promoting the use of metaheuristics and evolutionary computation to solve optimization problems in the energy domain.

Send me an email if you want further information, or visit the [offial websites of our compentitions](http://www.gecad.isep.ipp.pt/ERM-competitions/2021-2/).
