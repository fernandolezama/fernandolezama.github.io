Under Construction!!

We organize competitions regarding the use of metaheuristics and evolutionary computation to solve optimization problems in the energy domain.

### Current competitions

* Evolutionary Computation in Uncertain Environments: A Smart Grid Application. at [CEC2019](http://cec2019.org/programs/competitions.html#cec-05) and [GECCO2019](https://gecco-2019.sigevo.org/index.html/Competitions#id_Evolutionary%20Computation%20in%20Uncertain%20Environments:%20A%20Smart%20Grid%20Application)
