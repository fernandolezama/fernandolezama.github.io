## Implementation of HyDE-DF algorithm.

Please download "[1] HyDE-DF implementation" to test the algorithm and perform modifications if needed. You can use [2] and [3] to go deep into the material of papers using HyDE-DF.

* [1] HyDE-DF implementation: Ready to be tested in 50 benchmark functions. Note this is the source code of the algorithm ease to test and modify. [Matlab Code](code/HyDEDF_SWEVO2019.rar)[(Github-Repository)](https://github.com/fernandolezama/HyDEDF_Source)

* [2] HyDE-DF (All experiments!!!) for Lezama et al.: HyDE-DF: A novel self-adaptive version of differential evolution for numerical optimization. Swarm and evolutionary computation. 2019
[(Github-Repository)](https://github.com/fernandolezama/HyDE-DF_SWEVO2019_Experiments)

* [3] HyDE-DF (with reinitialization) as used in Lezama et al: Hybrid-adaptive differential evolution with decay function (HyDE-DF) applied to the 100-digit challenge competition on single objective numerical optimization. GECCO2019. [<span style="color:#C31D1D;">(Matlab Code)</span>](code/100-Digits-93Score-master.rar) [(Github-Repository)](https://github.com/fernandolezama/100-Digit-HyDEDF-93Digits)
