## Short Biography

I am currently a research assistant at GECAD, Polytechnic of Porto, working with Professor [Zita Vale](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=08O4oUkAAAAJ&hl=es) in computational intelligence for smart grid applications. Previously, from 2015 to 2017, I was a postdoctoral researcher at the National Institute of Astrophysics, Optics, and Electronics (INAOE), Mexico. In 2014, I received the Ph.D. in Information and Communication Technologies under the supervision of [Prof. Gerardo Castanon](http://homepages.mty.itesm.mx/gerardo.castanon) from the Tecnologico de Monterrey (ITESM), Mexico. I also hold a B.S. in Electronic Engineering and an M.S degree in Electronics (Telecommunications).

## Research Interest

Computational Intelligence, Evolutionary Computation, Smart Grids and Computer Networks
